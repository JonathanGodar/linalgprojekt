In this case, it's less \"using\" the available means of persuasion, but the \"seeing\" that is more commonly helpful for me.\n\nDay-to-day, though, I think it has just made me a better communicator in general. Rhetoric has made it easier for me to talk to people from different walks of life, understand where they are coming from the best I can, and speak in a way that will best get my point across. Rarely am I trying to \"convince\" people of things day-to-day, but I sort of see communication in general as one person trying their best to \"persuade\" the other into understanding or empathizing with what is in their mind.\n\nLanguage is an imperfect tool for the quest of thought communication.

It's to basically listen a lot and ask questions that aim to clarify what they say. At a certain point, the conversation will be abandoned, or go in circles. That's the moment you press the brakes with a counter argument or critical question.\n\nPeople often don't internalise your arguments if they have the feeling you don't fully understand their position. Reflective listening aims to demonstrate that understanding. A critical argument is so much more persuasive if you plant it in fertile soil.\n\n**A meta-level skill:**\n\nThe second thing is more abstract, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you struggle with speaking authentically because social settings stress you out: you must get out of your head and into your body. I know it sounds kind of woo-woo, but it's actually true and a legitimate framing device in cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nWhen I was treated for my social anxiety, I learned that when i go to the store I should shift my attention to phenomena instead of my thoughts *about* those phenomena. What makes you lock into that state is cycling your attention between what you see, what you hear, what you smell and what you touch.\n\nWhen you speak with someone, it's a bit difficult to step into your body because you have to listen and analyse what they're saying. However, here you can focus on congruence. You lock into it by focussing on aligning your thoughts, words, and actions. If you do this for a while you'll notice that the gap between words and thoughts becomes blurrier.

(Rarely is it the case that, say, some message is so irresistible that merely getting someone to entertain it will thereby persuade them, hence it only contributes to some degree.)\n\nBut, I was also thinking, if getting on someone\u2019s mind is not a part of persuasion as rhetoricians think about it, it is still a precondition for persuasion in the rhetorician's sense, isn't it?

There's a very clear exigence, a few different audiences (NASA employees, the students of the teacher on the shuttle and similar students, the US population in general, etc.), and constraints (each belonging to different audiences and sometimes directly conflicting with other audiences' constraints), and Reagan is able to navigate it amazingly. It's also about 4 minutes long, so you can easily screen it in full in a class.

There are many departments, in every discipline, that have the same issue. There are lots of Lit folks who care a lot about decolonial education and a lot of people in Rhetoric & Comp who don't. And there was famously a Comm Rhetoric department that did the exact same thing about 8 years ago that you experienced (it was known as the top program in the discipline for it's anti-racist scholarship, then they fired all but 1 non-white scholars over 2 years, and now they're pretty mediocre). Even if you conclude Rhetoric & Comp will be better, you should pause to consider whether possibly putting yourself through that again is the best choice. Maybe you'll decide yes, but you know that no discipline will be free of the issues your experienced.\n\nSecond, there's definitely some general truth to your experience. Rhetoric & Comp tends to focus a lot on pedagogy (in scholarship, at least--often the \"news\" in a Rhet & Comp publication is the pedagogical implications, but the people can be just as biased as in any other discipline). That means they're often more focused on topics like decolonial education. So, despite cautioning you, if you're interested it's worth doing campus visits (that the department will pay for) to see if there's a department that's a good fit.\n\nThird, I could recommend a couple Comm Rhetoric departments (my background) that'd be worth checking out, but I don't feel confident recommending English Rhet & Comp departments.", "t1_jvxtcop": "It is called \"**prebuttal**\" or **procatalepsis**.

Im aware that the job market is hard and that\u2019s the age old issue that I\u2019ve been aware of for years, but I wouldn\u2019t feel okay with myself if I didn\u2019t at least try.

Because of the hardships in academia I could only do what other Humanities PhD students have done and (hopefully) be where the true calling is. I\u2019m not so much making decisions based on personalities of the departments as I am the ongoings of the department because how bureaucratic ongoings are handled can negatively impact students. When I say my Lit department has been power hungry, I mean I see the way that they are trying to capitalize off their students to control tho WHOLE English department that umbrellas the Rhetoric department and the English education department. So that matters to me. This department has interfered with the hiring process for rhetoric and they even ruined their own chances of obtaining its own PhD program. There are also WAY TOO MANY married couples which I find baffling. Like way too many. And those couples are the people making highly important decisions on behalf of the whole department. Meanwhile, the rhetoric department has been building community, and receiving grants to expand, and has PhD students coming in from across the globe. I am also aware that every institution has these departments under different umbrellas. Some rhet/ comp departments are under communication departments while others are not. It\u2019s not the personalities rather than ethics and the way they handle the bureaucracy that I am highly concerned about. \nThis really makes me think of your comment about respect. I noticed that the comp rhetoricians were not at all respected by the rest of the department. Idk what is going on at this institution but if this is how it is across the board I pretty much would like to know of others\u2019 experiences. Would you mind if I ask another question?

It's a tough occupation, especially in the beginning, and there are basically no jobs out there.\n\nIf you do ANY of these things you need a backup plan.

The one is a sign for the other.\n\nA metaphor might be \"We're safe, our salvation is here!\" to express the same sentiment. \"Salvation\" has no direct relationship to \"Batman.\" Instead, we're trying to borrow the qualities of one thing--salvation, which may have connotations of redemption, holiness, morality, etc.--to lend those qualities to an unrelated thing--Batman.\n\nIn that twitter thread, the notion of the \"completion of metonymy\" that it's asking for is gibberish. There are some discussions of the \"completion of metaphor,\" but this usually just refers to narrative expectation. It means crafting a metaphor such that it fits the narrative and is satisfying for the reader. It doesn't really mean anything in terms of \"completion\"; I've always thought it meant something more like \"good\" or \"bad\" metaphors, but from people who realize their claims about \"good\" metaphors are dubious and are trying to find some stand-in to sound more authoritative.\n\nNB: The relationship between metaphor and metonymy is fuzzy.
