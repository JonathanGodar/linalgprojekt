We had one kitten who was super destructive, we both worked a lot, and the vet recommended a second cat to help him with his behavioral issues. \n\nOver the next year, we had many many discussions about getting another cat. He was adamant that he did not want one. Despite the fact that I did want one, I would have NEVER brought another cat home without his permission.\n\nEventually, I dropped the subject as it was a point of contention between us and all of the sudden, a few months later, *he* came to *me* about getting a second kitten. He picked out the second kitten. He had 100% say in the second kitten through the entire adoption process. \n\nNow, we both couldn\u2019t be happier with our choice as it has really settled our first kitten down that they can play with each other.\n\nThat being said, cats are not dogs. Dogs require an enormous amount of work. My best friend owns a very large dog and I once did the calculations \u2014 I could feed 8 cats extremely high end food for the cost of what she feeds her single dog every month. They need to be walked, they need to be let out. They are capable of 10x more destruction than cats. I would have NEVER brought home any animal without my partner\u2019s full agreeance.

But I think it\u2019s worth considering, because right now it looks to me like there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover.  And I think that while you consider cleaning to be stress management, it may not actually be doing that job for you, because of the OCD.\n\nIn the meantime, what about trying to work out a system of deescalation with your bf?  For example, establish ahead of time (when not stressed or angry) that, when either of you says a signal word of some sort, it\u2019s a clear signal that you\u2019re fraying badly.  Then that person says \u201cI need (X)\u201d, where X can be \u201ca half hour alone\u201d or \u201csome quiet in the apartment\u201d or \u201cto be held\u201d or \u201ca conversation\u201d or whatever.  Then the other person gives that person the space or support they need, and both of you make concerted efforts not to escalate in volume or tone.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say \u201cclean for me!\u201d  This is solely about trying to deescalate and destress so that you can continue communication together.  Then you can approach the conversation of chores from a less stressed, less angry perspective.  After that, apologize to each other for any harsh words that happen, or neglect, or just contributing to the stress.  The more you do that when stress flares up, the easier it will be to do again.  Eventually, that will come more easily than angry lashing out.\n\nAgain, it may be that ultimately, you\u2019re too far apart on the household management spectrum to resolve together.  It may be that he\u2019s just not going to be up to the level of cleaning that you require - it\u2019s onerous for a lot of people to deep clean.  But I think of you can work out a better system of deescalation and communication - that is, address the issue calmly and fairly before it reaches the angry shouting and threats - then at least you can find out whether you can find a long term compromise that you\u2019re both happy with.", "t1_kbisr1e": "I didn\u2019t even need to read the post to tell you NO.

She will defend her parents like you do with yours. You are the one who cannot ignore their fights and your mom is creating drama by complaining to you in the first place. I know Indian customs and Indian aunties who pick fights over the boys parents not being prioritised at any situation. All the formalities in India with respecting your elders is tiring. She should definitely divorce you if you keep fighting about how your mom is treated, your mom is an adult right? Why can't she handle it on her own . My in-laws and parents have fights but at the end of the day both of them want to be friends so they will forgive and forget. You shouldn't get involved in this. If your mom needs to solve the problem, involving you is stupidity and shows your mom has no intention of forgiving or forgetting.
