In this case, it's less \"using\" the available means of persuasion, but the \"seeing\" that is more commonly helpful for me.\n\nDay-to-day, though, I think it has just made me a better communicator in general. Rhetoric has made it easier for me to talk to people from different walks of life, understand where they are coming from the best I can, and speak in a way that will best get my point across. Rarely am I trying to \"convince\" people of things day-to-day, but I sort of see communication in general as one person trying their best to \"persuade\" the other into understanding or empathizing with what is in their mind.\n\nLanguage is an imperfect tool for the quest of thought communication.

It's to basically listen a lot and ask questions that aim to clarify what they say. At a certain point, the conversation will be abandoned, or go in circles. That's the moment you press the brakes with a counter argument or critical question.\n\nPeople often don't internalise your arguments if they have the feeling you don't fully understand their position. Reflective listening aims to demonstrate that understanding. A critical argument is so much more persuasive if you plant it in fertile soil.\n\n**A meta-level skill:**\n\nThe second thing is more abstract, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you struggle with speaking authentically because social settings stress you out: you must get out of your head and into your body. I know it sounds kind of woo-woo, but it's actually true and a legitimate framing device in cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nWhen I was treated for my social anxiety, I learned that when i go to the store I should shift my attention to phenomena instead of my thoughts *about* those phenomena. What makes you lock into that state is cycling your attention between what you see, what you hear, what you smell and what you touch.\n\nWhen you speak with someone, it's a bit difficult to step into your body because you have to listen and analyse what they're saying. However, here you can focus on congruence. You lock into it by focussing on aligning your thoughts, words, and actions. If you do this for a while you'll notice that the gap between words and thoughts becomes blurrier.

(Rarely is it the case that, say, some message is so irresistible that merely getting someone to entertain it will thereby persuade them, hence it only contributes to some degree.)\n\nBut, I was also thinking, if getting on someone\u2019s mind is not a part of persuasion as rhetoricians think about it, it is still a precondition for persuasion in the rhetorician's sense, isn't it?

There's a very clear exigence, a few different audiences (NASA employees, the students of the teacher on the shuttle and similar students, the US population in general, etc.), and constraints (each belonging to different audiences and sometimes directly conflicting with other audiences' constraints), and Reagan is able to navigate it amazingly.

There are many departments, in every discipline, that have the same issue. There are lots of Lit folks who care a lot about decolonial education and a lot of people in Rhetoric & Comp who don't. And there was famously a Comm Rhetoric department that did the exact same thing about 8 years ago that you experienced (it was known as the top program in the discipline for it's anti-racist scholarship, then they fired all but 1 non-white scholars over 2 years, and now they're pretty mediocre). Even if you conclude Rhetoric & Comp will be better, you should pause to consider whether possibly putting yourself through that again is the best choice. Maybe you'll decide yes, but you know that no discipline will be free of the issues your experienced.\n\nSecond, there's definitely some general truth to your experience. Rhetoric & Comp tends to focus a lot on pedagogy (in scholarship, at least--often the \"news\" in a Rhet & Comp publication is the pedagogical implications, but the people can be just as biased as in any other discipline). That means they're often more focused on topics like decolonial education. So, despite cautioning you, if you're interested it's worth doing campus visits (that the department will pay for) to see if there's a department that's a good fit.\n\nThird, I could recommend a couple Comm Rhetoric departments (my background) that'd be worth checking out, but I don't feel confident recommending English Rhet & Comp departments.", "t1_jvxtcop": "It is called \"**prebuttal**\" or **procatalepsis**.

Im aware that the job market is hard and that\u2019s the age old issue that I\u2019ve been aware of for years, but I wouldn\u2019t feel okay with myself if I didn\u2019t at least try.

Because of the hardships in academia I could only do what other Humanities PhD students have done and (hopefully) be where the true calling is. I\u2019m not so much making decisions based on personalities of the departments as I am the ongoings of the department because how bureaucratic ongoings are handled can negatively impact students. When I say my Lit department has been power hungry, I mean I see the way that they are trying to capitalize off their students to control tho WHOLE English department that umbrellas the Rhetoric department and the English education department. So that matters to me. This department has interfered with the hiring process for rhetoric and they even ruined their own chances of obtaining its own PhD program. There are also WAY TOO MANY married couples which I find baffling. Like way too many. And those couples are the people making highly important decisions on behalf of the whole department. Meanwhile, the rhetoric department has been building community, and receiving grants to expand, and has PhD students coming in from across the globe. I am also aware that every institution has these departments under different umbrellas. Some rhet/ comp departments are under communication departments while others are not. It\u2019s not the personalities rather than ethics and the way they handle the bureaucracy that I am highly concerned about. \nThis really makes me think of your comment about respect. I noticed that the comp rhetoricians were not at all respected by the rest of the department. Idk what is going on at this institution but if this is how it is across the board I pretty much would like to know of others\u2019 experiences. Would you mind if I ask another question?

It's a tough occupation, especially in the beginning, and there are basically no jobs out there.\n\nIf you do ANY of these things you need a backup plan.

The courts job is not to figure out exactly what happend, that is impossible, but to find a story that is as accurate as possible. With other words: one can say that any judgement a judge can perform have to relay on stories that never will be accurate. I do not say that judges do wrong in doing this. I only mean to say that this forced inaccuracy makes rhetorics very powerful. I know it sounds like I am against how things are done, I am not. I only want to point out how important it is to know how influencing the storytelling is in court, and at the same point asking you guys is the storytelling-perspective given enough focus in the understanding of courtroom-rhetorics.\n\nEspecially are trials where the prosecution don't have a lot of proof, but (for example) have to focus on motive, the accused's personality (ethos), and the lack of other potential suspects; cases where the potential for damaging the chances for a fair trial is increased. When the story's focus is switched from the proofs over to the accused, the requirements for a apparently accurate story is reduced and the potential for rhetorically hidden beneficial storytelling increased. \n\nAt the University of Bergen in Norway  they have studied a lot of murder cases where the judge and the jury's underestimation of the influence of storytelling has led to not necessarily wrong judgements, but at least inaccurate judgements, where the punishment is done on wrong foundation. \n\nExamples on this murder cases: The Orderud-case, Fritz Moen-case and Baneheia-case.", "t1_ijf3mxj": "Depends on what you mean. The short answer is yes, they're aware of rhetorical effects, but they don't study rhetoric.\n\nA few years ago, I read a book from a prolific lawyer claiming that rhetoric has been forgotten and ignored since classical Greek, so lawyers need to finally return to that art. He seriously said that rhetoric has not been studied in 2,000 years and there isn't, you know, 2 entire disciplines devoted to it's study (Rhetoric & Composition and Communication Rhetoric). And somehow his reviewers, editors, and audience of JDs just accepted that claim as true. They genuinely believed rhetoric is some arcane art that has been ignored by the profession. The book didn't even say anything innovative about rhetoric (in fact, almost everything in that book could have been easily disproven by any professional rhetoric scholar).\n\nI'd accept their belief about their own focus at face value--legal professionals don't seriously study rhetoric.\n\nBut on the broader level of \"Does the language we use matter?\" or \"Should we craft language to persuade and bring about certain effects?\" then of course they're aware of rhetoric. A huge part of the legal profession, and many legal decisions, is parsing the language of laws and common law to understand meaning and intent. A huge part of what judges do every day is analyzing rhetoric.\n\nAnd a large part of most JDs' training is how to present arguments in ways that appeal to juries in jury trials. That's also clearly rhetoric.\n\nSo of course judges are aware of rhetoric and how differences in language can cause different effects.

He wasn't any great shakes, but he had good moments. You don't stay a career politician as long as he has without being a sufficient sophist.\n\nBiden for many years has been fantastic at telling stories, especially involving his background and his family. Stories have been where he really shines, as he plays up to emotional appeal exceedingly well. His stories are grounded in an American mythos associated with a more traditional grasp of American culture. While it contrasts his more progressive trajectory and the values of his compatriots, it has still worked for framing his discussions. An example of his use of mythos is when he places the listener \"at the dinner table with your family.\" Regardless of whether or not most Americans share dinner at the table anymore, it creates an almost palpable visual. Although this mythos can also wear thin due to a lack of updating. When Biden mentions his son Beau, he usually can't help but include the fact that Beau was a military veteran--ignoring that the sentiment toward the military, especially within his base, is extremely low.\n\nBiden has two primary issues, however: he makes bombastic claims, and gets defensive toward people who ask him questions. Getting arrested on the way to see Nelson Mandela, being a \"full-professor,\" driving an 18-wheeler, spending time with Xi Jinpeng in the foothills of the Himalayas, etc.\n\nWhen Biden gets flustered or caught off-guard by a question, he often lashes out.

I appreciate the effort though. A problem well stated is half solved, or in other words, the better you ask the question, the easier it is to answer.\n\nBut your phrasing still shows a misunderstanding. For example, \"elements of persuasion\" could refer to anything really and texts don't apply an \"appropriate rhetorical situation.\" I'm still not convinced you're asking the question in good faith, having supplied all the information you could supply.\n\nBut lets step back a second. I did get the gist of your question. I just didn't think you were seriously asking, in effect, \"what's the greatest text of all time with the best rhetoric?\"\n\nI mean, you might as well ask what is the best color, the best kind of dog, the best poem, the best painting, the best movie, the best cereal . . . And as soon as you ask those questions, you realize that no one can answer them.\n\nThe best dog for someone who likes snowshoeing may be different than the best dog for someone who has a lot of cats, but they are both right. Both dogs are best for different things. So what does the word \"best\" or \"greatest\" even mean, then? Not very much, I'm afraid.\n\nNow, you might ask: \"well, best *for what*?\"  The question of what is best is meaningless without supplying the \"for what.\" But now we are onto a different set of questions.\n\nWhat is the greatest text of all time? For what?\n\nAnd more to the point: Why? For what purpose are you asking this question? This is the kind of question whose answer will depend entirely, 100%, on the reason you're asking it. The more honest you are about the reason, the better the chance you can get a decent answer.\n\nRhetoric is situational. It is flexible and responds to circumstance. There is no best anything. The idea of one thing being the best in all situation is itself profoundly anti-rhetorical.", "t1_iavegk1": "This is a very good suggestion. I'd also suggest Pro Sextus Roscius, as a somewhat more condensed piece, perhaps requiring a bit less of the reader in terms of historical familiarity."}
