In this case, it's less \"using\" the available means of persuasion, but the \"seeing\" that is more commonly helpful for me.\n\nDay-to-day, though, I think it has just made me a better communicator in general. Rhetoric has made it easier for me to talk to people from different walks of life, understand where they are coming from the best I can, and speak in a way that will best get my point across. Rarely am I trying to \"convince\" people of things day-to-day, but I sort of see communication in general as one person trying their best to \"persuade\" the other into understanding or empathizing with what is in their mind.\n\nLanguage is an imperfect tool for the quest of thought communication.

It's to basically listen a lot and ask questions that aim to clarify what they say. At a certain point, the conversation will be abandoned, or go in circles. That's the moment you press the brakes with a counter argument or critical question.\n\nPeople often don't internalise your arguments if they have the feeling you don't fully understand their position. Reflective listening aims to demonstrate that understanding. A critical argument is so much more persuasive if you plant it in fertile soil.\n\n**A meta-level skill:**\n\nThe second thing is more abstract, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you struggle with speaking authentically because social settings stress you out: you must get out of your head and into your body. I know it sounds kind of woo-woo, but it's actually true and a legitimate framing device in cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nWhen I was treated for my social anxiety, I learned that when i go to the store I should shift my attention to phenomena instead of my thoughts *about* those phenomena. What makes you lock into that state is cycling your attention between what you see, what you hear, what you smell and what you touch.\n\nWhen you speak with someone, it's a bit difficult to step into your body because you have to listen and analyse what they're saying. However, here you can focus on congruence. You lock into it by focussing on aligning your thoughts, words, and actions. If you do this for a while you'll notice that the gap between words and thoughts becomes blurrier.

(Rarely is it the case that, say, some message is so irresistible that merely getting someone to entertain it will thereby persuade them, hence it only contributes to some degree.)\n\nBut, I was also thinking, if getting on someone\u2019s mind is not a part of persuasion as rhetoricians think about it, it is still a precondition for persuasion in the rhetorician's sense, isn't it?

Unfortunately, I've never done an assignment quite like that, so I can't offer too many suggestions. I'd second the suggestion of Captain Disillusion. Other channels like Veritasium, VSauce, or Numberphile might work too.\n\nI love to use Reagan's Challenger Shuttle Address (after the shuttle exploded) to explain the rhetorical situation (exigence, audience, constraints). It's an incredible speech which Reagan and his head speech-writer wrote over a period of four hours. There's a very clear exigence, a few different audiences (NASA employees, the students of the teacher on the shuttle and similar students, the US population in general, etc.), and constraints (each belonging to different audiences and sometimes directly conflicting with other audiences' constraints), and Reagan is able to navigate it amazingly. It's also about 4 minutes long, so you can easily screen it in full in a class. I don't view Reagan very favorably, but watching that speech anyone will see why he was called \"the Great Communicator.\"\n\nWhen I just want a general rhetorical analysis, I like pulling up advertisements. If I pick a 30 second ad, we can watch it 5 or 10 times, and I'll ask them to focus on a different aspect each time. I'm always impressed with what students are able to pick out. I've found that ads work especially well after the Superbowl. I'll watch all the most popular ones and pick one to spend most of a class on the following week.", "t1_jzws08o": "Any of them (standup, theater, and singing) can help your delivery. As in most areas, one of the best things you can do is practice them. Standup will help you master standup. Theater will help you master theater. And singing will help you master singing.\n\nTheater should help you a lot with declamation (reciting important speeches) and standup should help you a bit with extemporaneous speaking (where you know the ideas and some lines, but don't have it fully scripted out). I imagine singing could help with tone, but I'm absolutely not a singer and have never tried it. And for all three, just performing in front of an audience can help make your delivery more natural or ease public speaking anxiety.", "t1_jzwlner": "Thats wonderful! \n\nI found good material on archive.org already, now with your suggestions I have a good place to increase my repertoire. \n\nFurthermore, I believe, and so far holds true, that other areas have more practical advices on delivery, like stand-up.

I'm sure I'm missing some--I don't study that area much--but those are good to start with.\n\nIf you're interested in older texts, check of \"Institutes of Oratory\" by Quintillian. He covers a lot of subjects, including more theoretical ones, but he basically summarizes most of the important Classical Greek and Roman writers on rhetoric.\n\nThere are lots of modern books on delivery, at varying levels of quality. One warning is any book saying \"use X gesture; speak in Y tone, etc.\" warrants skepticism. The most important thing is always natural delivery. If something is unnatural to you, or clashes with your topic and tone, it'll sound bad. But no publisher will release a book saying only \"Speak naturally, use your own style,\" so those books on delivery tend to invent rules that are as likely to be counter-productive as they are to improve your speaking (even the \"essential\" or \"key\" books you'll find on top-10 lists on google).", "t1_jznqjw0": "Thank you for these suggestions - I will absolutely check them out.

But might be worth checking out Contrapoint\u2019s video on Opulence. I can\u2019t remember how political that one is, but I think it\u2019s less political than the others and you could maybe pull a few clips from it.\n\nEdit: also for an option that isn\u2019t a person talking on camera - Our Changing Climate does short, well produced voiceover videos on climate issues but that\u2019s more political.

There were a few Latinx PhD students/candidates there during my time, and I believe they all prospered, but there are only 2 non-white professors and also I'm white and those students may not have wanted to talk about racial issues with me.
