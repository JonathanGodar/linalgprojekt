In this case, it's less \"using\" the available means of persuasion, but the \"seeing\" that is more commonly helpful for me.\n\nDay-to-day, though, I think it has just made me a better communicator in general. Rhetoric has made it easier for me to talk to people from different walks of life, understand where they are coming from the best I can, and speak in a way that will best get my point across. Rarely am I trying to \"convince\" people of things day-to-day, but I sort of see communication in general as one person trying their best to \"persuade\" the other into understanding or empathizing with what is in their mind.\n\nLanguage is an imperfect tool for the quest of thought communication.

It's to basically listen a lot and ask questions that aim to clarify what they say. At a certain point, the conversation will be abandoned, or go in circles. That's the moment you press the brakes with a counter argument or critical question.\n\nPeople often don't internalise your arguments if they have the feeling you don't fully understand their position. Reflective listening aims to demonstrate that understanding. A critical argument is so much more persuasive if you plant it in fertile soil.\n\n**A meta-level skill:**\n\nThe second thing is more abstract, but I think it's worth mentioning. If you struggle with speaking authentically because social settings stress you out: you must get out of your head and into your body. I know it sounds kind of woo-woo, but it's actually true and a legitimate framing device in cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nWhen I was treated for my social anxiety, I learned that when i go to the store I should shift my attention to phenomena instead of my thoughts *about* those phenomena. What makes you lock into that state is cycling your attention between what you see, what you hear, what you smell and what you touch.\n\nWhen you speak with someone, it's a bit difficult to step into your body because you have to listen and analyse what they're saying. However, here you can focus on congruence. You lock into it by focussing on aligning your thoughts, words, and actions. If you do this for a while you'll notice that the gap between words and thoughts becomes blurrier.

(Rarely is it the case that, say, some message is so irresistible that merely getting someone to entertain it will thereby persuade them, hence it only contributes to some degree.)\n\nBut, I was also thinking, if getting on someone\u2019s mind is not a part of persuasion as rhetoricians think about it, it is still a precondition for persuasion in the rhetorician's sense, isn't it?

There's a very clear exigence, a few different audiences (NASA employees, the students of the teacher on the shuttle and similar students, the US population in general, etc.), and constraints (each belonging to different audiences and sometimes directly conflicting with other audiences' constraints), and Reagan is able to navigate it amazingly.

There are many departments, in every discipline, that have the same issue. There are lots of Lit folks who care a lot about decolonial education and a lot of people in Rhetoric & Comp who don't. And there was famously a Comm Rhetoric department that did the exact same thing about 8 years ago that you experienced (it was known as the top program in the discipline for it's anti-racist scholarship, then they fired all but 1 non-white scholars over 2 years, and now they're pretty mediocre). Even if you conclude Rhetoric & Comp will be better, you should pause to consider whether possibly putting yourself through that again is the best choice. Maybe you'll decide yes, but you know that no discipline will be free of the issues your experienced.\n\nSecond, there's definitely some general truth to your experience. Rhetoric & Comp tends to focus a lot on pedagogy (in scholarship, at least--often the \"news\" in a Rhet & Comp publication is the pedagogical implications, but the people can be just as biased as in any other discipline). That means they're often more focused on topics like decolonial education. So, despite cautioning you, if you're interested it's worth doing campus visits (that the department will pay for) to see if there's a department that's a good fit.\n\nThird, I could recommend a couple Comm Rhetoric departments (my background) that'd be worth checking out, but I don't feel confident recommending English Rhet & Comp departments.", "t1_jvxtcop": "It is called \"**prebuttal**\" or **procatalepsis**.

Im aware that the job market is hard and that\u2019s the age old issue that I\u2019ve been aware of for years, but I wouldn\u2019t feel okay with myself if I didn\u2019t at least try.

Because of the hardships in academia I could only do what other Humanities PhD students have done and (hopefully) be where the true calling is. I\u2019m not so much making decisions based on personalities of the departments as I am the ongoings of the department because how bureaucratic ongoings are handled can negatively impact students. When I say my Lit department has been power hungry, I mean I see the way that they are trying to capitalize off their students to control tho WHOLE English department that umbrellas the Rhetoric department and the English education department. So that matters to me. This department has interfered with the hiring process for rhetoric and they even ruined their own chances of obtaining its own PhD program. There are also WAY TOO MANY married couples which I find baffling. Like way too many. And those couples are the people making highly important decisions on behalf of the whole department. Meanwhile, the rhetoric department has been building community, and receiving grants to expand, and has PhD students coming in from across the globe. I am also aware that every institution has these departments under different umbrellas. Some rhet/ comp departments are under communication departments while others are not. It\u2019s not the personalities rather than ethics and the way they handle the bureaucracy that I am highly concerned about. \nThis really makes me think of your comment about respect. I noticed that the comp rhetoricians were not at all respected by the rest of the department. Idk what is going on at this institution but if this is how it is across the board I pretty much would like to know of others\u2019 experiences. Would you mind if I ask another question?

It's a tough occupation, especially in the beginning, and there are basically no jobs out there.\n\nIf you do ANY of these things you need a backup plan.

The courts job is not to figure out exactly what happend, that is impossible, but to find a story that is as accurate as possible. With other words: one can say that any judgement a judge can perform have to relay on stories that never will be accurate. I do not say that judges do wrong in doing this. I only mean to say that this forced inaccuracy makes rhetorics very powerful. I know it sounds like I am against how things are done, I am not. I only want to point out how important it is to know how influencing the storytelling is in court, and at the same point asking you guys is the storytelling-perspective given enough focus in the understanding of courtroom-rhetorics.\n\nEspecially are trials where the prosecution don't have a lot of proof, but (for example) have to focus on motive, the accused's personality (ethos), and the lack of other potential suspects; cases where the potential for damaging the chances for a fair trial is increased. When the story's focus is switched from the proofs over to the accused, the requirements for a apparently accurate story is reduced and the potential for rhetorically hidden beneficial storytelling increased. \n\nAt the University of Bergen in Norway  they have studied a lot of murder cases where the judge and the jury's underestimation of the influence of storytelling has led to not necessarily wrong judgements, but at least inaccurate judgements, where the punishment is done on wrong foundation. \n\nExamples on this murder cases: The Orderud-case, Fritz Moen-case and Baneheia-case.", "t1_ijf3mxj": "Depends on what you mean. The short answer is yes, they're aware of rhetorical effects, but they don't study rhetoric.\n\nA few years ago, I read a book from a prolific lawyer claiming that rhetoric has been forgotten and ignored since classical Greek, so lawyers need to finally return to that art. He seriously said that rhetoric has not been studied in 2,000 years and there isn't, you know, 2 entire disciplines devoted to it's study (Rhetoric & Composition and Communication Rhetoric). And somehow his reviewers, editors, and audience of JDs just accepted that claim as true. They genuinely believed rhetoric is some arcane art that has been ignored by the profession. The book didn't even say anything innovative about rhetoric (in fact, almost everything in that book could have been easily disproven by any professional rhetoric scholar).\n\nI'd accept their belief about their own focus at face value--legal professionals don't seriously study rhetoric.\n\nBut on the broader level of \"Does the language we use matter?\" or \"Should we craft language to persuade and bring about certain effects?\" then of course they're aware of rhetoric. A huge part of the legal profession, and many legal decisions, is parsing the language of laws and common law to understand meaning and intent. A huge part of what judges do every day is analyzing rhetoric.\n\nAnd a large part of most JDs' training is how to present arguments in ways that appeal to juries in jury trials. That's also clearly rhetoric.\n\nSo of course judges are aware of rhetoric and how differences in language can cause different effects.

He wasn't any great shakes, but he had good moments. You don't stay a career politician as long as he has without being a sufficient sophist.\n\nBiden for many years has been fantastic at telling stories, especially involving his background and his family. Stories have been where he really shines, as he plays up to emotional appeal exceedingly well. His stories are grounded in an American mythos associated with a more traditional grasp of American culture. While it contrasts his more progressive trajectory and the values of his compatriots, it has still worked for framing his discussions. An example of his use of mythos is when he places the listener \"at the dinner table with your family.\" Regardless of whether or not most Americans share dinner at the table anymore, it creates an almost palpable visual. Although this mythos can also wear thin due to a lack of updating. When Biden mentions his son Beau, he usually can't help but include the fact that Beau was a military veteran--ignoring that the sentiment toward the military, especially within his base, is extremely low.\n\nBiden has two primary issues, however: he makes bombastic claims, and gets defensive toward people who ask him questions. Getting arrested on the way to see Nelson Mandela, being a \"full-professor,\" driving an 18-wheeler, spending time with Xi Jinpeng in the foothills of the Himalayas, etc.\n\nWhen Biden gets flustered or caught off-guard by a question, he often lashes out.

And if I was talking to non rhetoricians would, they would understand as well. \n\nTo take your Bitzer comment further. It might not even be down to situations, but genres instead.

It's probably an unsatisfying way to go, but  I figure like, the alienation of a word lets you make it meaningful in a way free from daily words, but I also think that like, you are just as likely to sound masturbatory if you take something commonly understood and start to make it your own. I think we could get the connotations in English if we needed to but I think the latin and greek phrases save us from awkward calques and compound phrases, which can be useful sometimes.

I kinda feel that term jerking, can become grandstanding in every day situations. In an academic situations, those non vernacular words would be useful. I also think the fact that those Greek and Latin terms has so much meaning, they might be imprecise. I think what's in the term is more important than the term itself. I also think if you make it clear that we are talking about speech craft aka rhetoric, the connotations from the Greek terms would emerge if you used the English equivalent of the greek and Latin terms.", "t1_fo22t6s": "Ah yeah I think I'm getting you more clearly and for sure I get you! I guess to some extent the way I think of it, and I can't really articulate this with recourse to specific sources very much, is that to me it helps to have a general concept alienated from daily speech. I guess what I mean by that is like, there's a lot of rhetorical scholarship that necessarily upholds the value of vernacular speech as a way of making speech/meaning/persuasion on the ground . There's work that brings \"vernacular\" techniques (and I use this term with some hesitation because of connotations, but you know what I mean, not like less valid language but more daily speech. What the saying, the difference between a language and a dialect is a navy?) into scholarly focus, like who was that guy was like \"Nevermind the Tagmemics, where's the Sex Pistols?\"  I can't call other necessary examples to mind off the top, but it's an important concern and something I'm sure we've both seen happen where rhetoricians try to coin terms for novel topics or phenomenon by drawing from their own vernacular contexts, especially where those vernaculars have belonged to oppressed groups, or have been otherwise unjustly discounted.\n\nI guess where the greek terms are relevant, what I mean by that useful alienation is that there's such a long precedence for naming a specific technique of discourse that it doesn't really help to try to give it a new coinage. It has a longer resonance, and ultimately the benefits of giving  a long talked about process a new naming are outweighed by the difficulties of overturning a very ancient convention in specialized scholarly exchange, both because it will always entail explaining yourself to the specialized community who are familiar with the older usage, and to the new community who are accustomed to the daily understanding of the translated term. Like Bitzer's \"Rhetorical Situation\" is useful but not because it replaces Kairos, it is not a description of technical focus but a way of understanding context. \"Kairos\" turns our attention to the immediate ground for technique, the creation of shared exigency, and has weight on its virtues as a unique term, where a \"rhetorical situation\" is more broadly about a specific arrangement of human agency with respect to a Kairotic moment, or a moment becoming Kairotic through human rhetorical behavior, distributed across various kinds of actors. It turns our attention not to how the moment itself is timely, or can be made timely, but how that process is coordinated through a larger variety of factors to which we must also be attentive. \n \nLike, on the level of daily exchange, as you mentioned these terms sound like gibberish but I guess for me that \"necessary alienation\" works like this: The greek/latin terms sound like gibberish at first, sure, but when you can work someone to them and help them understand what they mean, not only do you get the benefit of that history and cross cultural use, they also learn to tag a specific technique to that foreign word. They start like gibberish but end up being useful, intelligible, and memorable because of that difference. The alternative for ancient terms like Pathos, Ethos, Logos, is that as you noted you have to say \"appeal to emotion\", \"appeal to credibility\", etc, and in each case, and in ways that just get more complex and unwieldy the deeper you go, is that if I say \"logos, ethos, pathos\" after minimal definition that is all immediately understood as containing those appeals and the classic definitions of them. When I rely on the language I'm using to do the work that's already been done, I have to take something commonly used and make it specific through the use of compound phrases which is more awkward and less wieldy than using single specialized words in each case. \n\nWhen you start with daily language, for some things it actually to me confuses the issue. Like these greek terms can translate to daily vocabulary, but words like \"Logic\", \"Emotion\", \"credibility\" have a lot of really variant meanings and connotations and we can have the opposite problems where we take a commonly understood term and twist it into such a specialized usage that you find yourself putting more effort into clarifying what you mean in opposition to the daily understanding that it actually undermines you. \n\nLike I don't think we should get hung up on that history either, and I agree that a living tradition should be responsive to current circumstances, but terms which have historical resonance have advantages not only because of that historical resonance but also because they are so removed from daily conversation that their meanings have a specificity because people come to them blank. Like to not even speak of ancient language, \"denouement\" as a French loan is a useful way of describing \"falling action\" in Journalistic writing, where if we just used \"falling action\" it would take additional effort to differentiate non-fiction from fiction plotting and structure and might cause unnecessary conflation between two very different modes and purposes of writing in an outside audience. The use of alienated words eases the burden of taking a familiar word and adding too much to it, if that makes sense?\n\nI apologize for the wordiness, I've never benefited from a good internal sense of editing so I hope this is a coherent response.", "t1_fo0y3bb": "My guess is reappropriation, Wikipedia says it is: \u201cThe cultural process by which a group reclaims words or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.\u201d", "t1_fnws7qt": "I mean, if you talk with other rhetoricians, they will know what you mean by emotions, credibility or the argument, and if you aren't talking to rhetoricians, pathos, ethos and logos will sound like gibberish.\n\nLike: Logos is the argument in itself. Like enthymemes and syllogisms and so on. Pathos talk about how we use emotions in rhetorics. We could just call it appeal to emotion, which would be more than sufficient enough to describe what's going on. Ethos is the appeal to the speakers credibility.  Thus, appeal to credibility would be good enough.\n\nWhen it comes to kairos, we can just say we need to capture the moment. Meaning we have to speak at the right place and time, and know when not to. Alternatively, you can throw that old notion aside and talk about rhetorical situations that Bitzer was talking about. Rhetorics has done strides since the 50s. My point is simple, we shouldn't get hung up on terms from ancient Greece and Rome. Also, the rhetorical development didn't end with the greek and romans, also in the middle ages and renaissance, there was stuff that was happening. And like i mentioned, since the second world war, we've had an explosion in rhetorical theory, all devised in English, French, German, Spanish and Scandinavian languages like Norwegian, Danish and Swedish. Rhetoric is not a dead field of studies, but a field that keeps growing.", "t1_fnuppaw": "I dunno, if you know that stuff you know the answer, or at least I don't get what you mean. Terms are, for those reasons, used in Greek or Latinesque fashions because they have cross-cultural and historic resonance that way, which adds heft. It is an arrived upon convention of our genres of academic speech, so to say. You are still describing the processes in English because you forward the term then define it, but I guess you use that Greek or Latinesque term to begin with because the English versions sound more awkward? Like if I say \"Pathos\" it directly invokes the appeal, and the colors of that terms we've gotten from the Greeks. If I say \"Emotions\" it could be like, just the simple fact of feeling or a Carly Rae Jepsen album or whatever. If I say \"Kairos\" it directly invokes a concept outside of conversational English, it is free from the constraints and makes it easier to define and utilize in a memorable way. If I say \"Timeliness\" I have to do extra work to make it fit seamlessly because that could also just mean being punctual. \n\nIf I'm not really misunderstanding you I guess it just stops at it being a genre convention, which has been arrived upon because of those histories as a matters of linguistic convenience.

There are rhetorical scholars who draw from critical theorists like Foucault who frame things in terms of \"subjectivity\" over identity and try to pull apart how people's identities are constructed through a variety of discourses and social forces in the environment. I pulled alot from French critical theory in my research, like Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's work where they see \"identity\" as a constant process of becoming, of making and unmaking.\n\nThere are works in genre theory, like Dylan Dryer's Geographies of the Possible, where he sees genres of all different kinds as exerting ways of knowing and talking about things, they focus and limit our imagination about how we relate and what we can do. In his work, identity isn't something that people just simply have beforehand but something that we do as a verb, genres are a means where we find ourselves. We locate ourselves within them, so like in the genre of an academic essay you find yourself as a student in a submissive relationship to a teacher. In a city zoning law we find ourselves as citizens or consumers or small business owners, etc. Each genre allows different kinds of ways of constructing identity and relating to each other.\n\nThe thing is that you are asking a very broad question, because any conversation about what rhetoric is is also going to be about who does it and for what purposes. Even basic shit like ethos involves this, in that to establish credibility I have to model and speak in a way that confirms my authority in a way my audience expects. I can hardly say that Im say, a medical expert, if Im not bringing the behavior and vocabulary expected out of that to the forefront. If I show up in court in flip flops and daisy dukes what kind of lawyer am I?

It can also be helpful to listen to speakers you vehemently disagree with but seem to have passionate followings online (in my case: Ben Shapiro, Eric Weinstein, Ezra Klein). Also, stand up comedians are rhetorical masters and are very economical with their words, precise with their literary devices, and deliberate with the [chironomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironomia) (George Carlin, Louis CK, Jimmy Carr, Steven Wright, Emo Philips, Mitch Hedberg, Dave Chapelle). There may be *nothing* on Earth more persuasive than humor, besides maybe music or film.\n\nI also recommend listening to podcasts with *multiple* hosts (e.g. Slate's Political Gabfest or Joe Rogan's podcast) where you can get strong arguments and counterarguments locked in a dialectical back-and-forth.

What I took from Phaedrus is a method that Socrates took to \"dance\" rather than \"push\" your ideas. Thinking of spreading your knowledge to others is best kept on an impressionistic level and to slowly let both sides of the discussion play out, thus \"dancing\" as a metaphor for give and take in a discussion. This reduces the hostility that tends to come from the term \"argument\" and allows both sides to come to an understanding at their own pace. It's a good practice to engage with ideas with an open mind and to take yourself out of the equation when new information reaches you. By this I want to relay the subjective ways that we receive, internalize, and react to new knowledge.

But even those would have to be evaluated by an individual (or group of people) on their own merits.\n\nIt's probably not the \"scientific source\" you're looking for but Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics might be useful to you here. As a humanities grad student, my understanding of your question (using Ricoeur) is that references serve as additional data points to be interpreted by the reader in their attempt to decode the metaphors into which the referenced authors have deposited their ideas. The big thing is that Ricoeur believes that it is impossible to understand the meaning of the original author, only to decipher and combine the \"is\" and \"isn't\" components of a text (which becomes the readers individualized meaning of the author's intended meaning). So in this sense, your question of reference credibility becomes incredibly contextual. Evaluating the rhetoric of references properly includes considering who the author is, which are arguments and meta-discourses are deployed and how, what the medium of production is, where is the work being published, who is on the editorial boards, the intrinsic and extrinsic soundness of the references (ei how they are used and how they have existed before).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The idiosyncrasy of academic work is such that it must be matched by an equally multi-faceted hermeneutic approach.", "t1_fmh3w0r": "Are you thinking about something that reefers to apeals to reason (fronesis)?

Also, whenever an opinion is expressed it can be said to be being 'forced' upon the recipient, to add weight and gravitas to your opinions do not express them directly, or often, and only the ones you know they will readily agree to, over time this will build, in them, a respect for your opinion.\n\nIf you want to know more about the techniques and tricks of persuasive argument, the art of Rhetoric, try Jay Heinrichs', Thank you for arguing.", "t1_f4peent": "I don't think you need rhetoric but rather philosophy. Try stoicsm.", "t1_f4onxm7": "What do you want to achieve?", "t1_f417pzr": "Has anyone specifically said, tone \"of voice\" or only \"tone\"?\n\nIt may be that they are interpreting other things such as your body language, eye contact, or how direct your statements are.\n\nIn addition to voice control, you might consider looking at information on body language and facial expression. If you do truly struggle to control your voice, welcoming body language amd face could also help to mitigate the effect.", "t1_f40oq41": "Your doing the right thing, which is practice.\n\nAs you have identified this is not a rhetorical exercise so much as one of acting.\n\nHowever your remark about being 'cold and dismissive' may be indicative (how do you know this to be so?). It implies your interlocutor is aware you are not emotionally invested in your position (cold), and that you are not listening to their points (dismissive).\n\nBoth these issues are easily resolved. To appear 'warm', simply stick a wry smile on your face and speak through the smile, this will give the appearance of being amused. IF being amused doesn't suit you, you frown in a concerned way. Even better, get the drift of what I'm saying and construct a technique suited to you personally, (and to your personality), remember the idea is to convince your interlocutor that you are emotionally invested in your position. Pretend to be angry they're not getting it etc.\n\nNot appearing dismissive is even easier, thought, it does encompass the need to be mindful and not being too involved in the argument itself, again, easy with this technique; listen to what they have to say. Let them talk out their position, explain in torrid detail their point of view on the matter. Take it a little further, ask them questions about their position, even, (oooh advanced technique coming up) agree their points, (I see what your saying, I understand, that's an interesting point/perspective).\n\nVis tone of voice specifically, keeping your tone low and relaxed will give a sense of gravitas, high pitched indicated tension and involvement.\n\nOn the subject of exercises; Film yourself with your mobile phone. Get a text (any will do, but a speech or play might be best) read for one minute to camera, immediately review, rinse and repeat. As you repeat begin to vary the variables towards your objectives, (ie: lengthen the recording, change or memorize the text, whatever you think might work. Experiment.). If you don't have phone, in a pinch you can use a mirror.\n\nRemember you are not so much trying to correct a fault, as add tools and techniques to your kit bag.", "t1_f3wq990": "Good elaboration on the definition of rhetoric, thanks.\n\n> what is the goal of culling in relation to this conversation? You noted that shark depletion seriously harms the marine environment.. what data are they bringing to the table that culling...doesn't threaten species preservation?\n\nNot a great deal.   Proponents of culling concede harms to  the ocean environment, though there is big disagreement over the extent.  This is to be expected; there are all sorts of debates about *charismatic megafauna* and their role in ecology. \n\nA basic definition: \"Large animal species with symbolic value or widespread popular appeal, and are often used by environmental activists to achieve environmentalist goals.\"  (The definition hints at a use for *agenda purposes.*)\n\nAnother animal example, [according to facts accepted by most people, some 300,000 wolves still roam Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_gray_wolf_populations_by_country) and that figure is fairly stable.  Yet many environmentalists regard wolf decline a pressing worldwide concern--[Is the gray wolf still endangered? Depends who you ask.](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/03/gray-wolves-endangered-species-united-states/)  These endangered species/environmental degradation debates often impasse.  *And that's fine--there is room for differences of opinion.*\n\nThe shark culling safety topic, a separate question, is much more straightforward science.  Not near as much room for bias or  ethical considerations.   There are some basic truths here, and they have failed to come to the surface, one reason being that definitive answers to these questions:\n\n1) Exactly how dangerous are sharks to humans? and 2) Does the very low level of shark attack we see, [less than 100 events worldwide per year, on average](https://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanmadden/2019/03/05/the-2018-global-shark-attack-summary-is-out/#1412cf1c7400), relate to the fact that [humans kill 100 million sharks a year](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/humans-killing-100-million-sharks-year-180923150037790.html)?\n\n...will only work out poorly for shark conservationists.  They are inconvenient questions for conservation.  So the marine science analysis of culling deliberately, subtly, keeps the topic muddled and inconclusive, IMO.  Which might make a good topic for people interested in rhetoric to look at.  Might we call the topic *a case of obfuscation?*\n\n- - - -\n\nBy the way, I grant the topic seems fringe, inconsequential, but it is a valid concern for some coastal communities.  A baseline of sorts are the attacks that occurred in a 14 week period in [South Africa in 1957: 9 attacked, 6 dead](https://chondrichthyes.fandom.com/wiki/Black_December).  They prompted S. Africa to start culling sharks, still ongoing today--60-plus years uninterrupted shark population suppression.  (Shark conservationists assert the attacks were an aberrant event.)", "t1_f3wa5a6": "Well, I don't mean to sound belligerent, but ... yes and no.\n\nRhetoric is certainly concerned with the construction of meaning, which frequently involves delivering a compelling argument to one or more audiences. An argument might involve objective \"truth\" or not, but the values of an audience may define truth in certain ways that don't always align with an objective reality.\n\nSo when it comes to discussing a particular argument as misleading, it is accurate that we'd need to know what the community at hand would accept as \"true\" (or something that seems like the truth, e.g., statistical likelihood, commonly observed phenomena that approach being reliable or replicable, etc.).\n\nThe notion of hedging statements to build arguments that are compelling--or at least acceptable--to the community is a way that can, for academic audiences, make claims seem stronger by virtue of their acknowledged boundaries/limitations. \n\nSo one might ask, expressly or not: what is the goal of culling in relation to this conversation? You noted that shark depletion seriously harms the marine environment. If that statement reflects the consensus opinion, why would it be contested without serious evidence to the contrary?\n\nIt's an example of a (prevailing?) ecological conservation paradigm. There's a \"truth\" that is accepted in this paradigm--that is, the logic of less culling -> more effective preservation of species.\n\nSo if someone is going to push back against that, what data are they bringing to the table that culling is effective _not only_ as a means of reducing shark attack incident frequency _but also_ as an action that doesn't threaten species preservation? That question does not appear to be addressed in the above discussion (in the provided quotes; I haven't explored the linked chapter in full).", "t1_f3w84l7": "I find the debate worthwhile...perhaps many people don't.  The issue is whether culling opponents have crafted a poorly supported/misleading narrative.  \n\nThat's a goal of rhetoric right, to help ascertain truth?  There's all sort of agendas out there, advocacy for X, Y,  Z etc.   I place rhetoric alongside science in helping us understand what is true and accurate.", "t1_f3w4it9": "Hedging interpretations/conclusions from data is hardly specific to this topic, though.", "t1_f3w4g1u": "What exactly are you asking us to weigh in on?", "t1_f3w3zk5": "The previous poster called the conclusions hedged and I agree with that.   It is indicative of so many papers written on the topic.\n\nI wrote a big piece below that overviews this shark culling debate; perhaps you might find interest in commenting on or contesting something there.  \n\n In sum, I consider the shark conservation movement's campaign against shark culling significantly more advocacy  than objective science.  But these scientists do an effective job of slanting their perspective; they dodge criticism well.", "t1_f3w31wm": "No contradiction.\n\nThe second quotation is describing different potential causes, not agreeing with those causes. To quote the sentence in full:\n\n>In addition to the influence of human population growth, other factors that may explain the increase in unprovoked shark bites include an increase in abundance of shark species frequently implicated in unprovoked bites, and/or a natural or anthropogenic change in these species habitat use or behavior\n\nThe next section of the paper deals with abundance of relevant species, and says that's unlikely to be a cause. At the end of that section (bottom of the same page), the author states their conclusion:\n\n>Overall, while some uncertainties exist, there is no compelling body of evidence that suggests that the population abundance of relevant shark species is increasing, or increasing to the extent to explain the increasing trend in unprovoked shark bites.\n\nThe section after that deals with species habitat use and behavior (the other potential cause in the passage you quote), and says that there is a demonstrable correlation there.\n\nSo, to restate those two passages and the next, using A (increase in human population), B (increase in relevant shark population), and C (habitat use and behavior): The abstract says \"A is part of the problem, but it's unlikely B is.\" the passage you quote says \"A is part of the problem. We can imagine a world where B and C could also be part.\" Then the next two sections say \"Evidence doesn't support that B is part of the problem, C is part.\"", "t1_f3w1xsw": "Yes, *hedged* is a fair conclusion.  \n\nIt is one of the more interesting science debates of the day, and near completely unresolved.  Virtually all marine scientists want shark populations to rebound, and any interpretation that clearly links *more sharks to more attacks* poses a problem for that perspective, as it tend to support culling.\n\nHawaii scientists in 1994 were one of the first to [issue a challenge](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/2202), concluding that the killing of 4,668 sharks between between 1959 and 1976 did \"not \nappear to have had measurable effects on the rate of shark attacks in Hawaiian \nwaters.\"  The conclusion is justifiable.  (By the way, *does not appear* is a pretty big qualification.  And the fact that something is difficult to measure does not necessarily mean it does not work.)\n\nSince then some researchers have been more emphatic about the lack of correlation; one took to task both culling programs in Australia and South Africa.[This  book chapter on the Great White Shark explains how they work, pp. 492-494](https://sharkspotters.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Curtis-et-al.-Responding-to-the-risk-of-white-shark-attack-sm.pdf).  The critic:\n\n>Associate Professor Laurie Laurenson from Deakin University...[has analysed 50 years of data about shark mitigation programs](https://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/shark-nets-do-nothing-reduce-chance-attack-study/2923848/) in (Australia) and South Africa.  He (said) reducing the density of local shark populations did not reduce the likelihood of shark attack.  \"I can show statistically that there is no relationship between the number of sharks out there and the number of shark attacks,\" he said.\n\nThis latter statement is absurd; clearly no one would make a similar assertion about human-wildlife conflict involving crocodiles, lions, or tigers.  (The record of how attacks have fallen for each of these predators as man has reduced their populations worldwide is incontrovertible.)\n\nShark depletion seriously harms the marine environment, but the public safety issue is a separate matter.  The concern for the former is so acute that few marine scientists will enter the debate on the *yes there is a link* side.\n\nI raised this topic here a year ago, because it is not exclusively a marine science debate.  It is also a logic and deduction debate, involving the general practice of *culling,* which does not require a PhD to comprehend.   This might be of interest to rhetoricians because this is a debate where the winning side, the shark conservationist side, has been able to obfuscate an issue and qualify and hedge their conclusions so effectively few people have tried--or are willing to try--to refute their case.\n\n(In the book link, the scientists who run the shark control programs in Australia and South Africa disagree with the *culling does not work* notion; they state their programs have been \"very successful in reducing the incidence of shark attack.\" (p. 493) But in the open marketplace of ideas, these researchers rarely contest the *culling does not work* contingent.) \n\n\nIf any rhetoricians want to weigh in....", "t1_f3vnn64": "While I am not a marine scientist, it does not read to me like a contradiction. It is a significantly hedged/qualified interpretation of the data.\n\nSpecifically, the authors seem to be making it clear that they are not _confidently_ ascribing this increase to human population growth or to shark species abundance (noting in the latter case that they see its role as an unlikely factor), but neither do they feel confident in ruling out either as potential contributions to their findings.", "t1_f3byge0": "Thanks for the recommendation.", "t1_f3byg3q": "Thanks for replying.", "t1_f3byfvy": "Thank you, it\u2019s been a long time since I took a philosophy class.

I wouldn't suggest you start with Adams Hill or Brainerd Kellogg, though Kellogg is more influential in US rhetoric in particular.\n\nA great place to start would be Hugh Blair's \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettre.\" He created the chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettre (roughly \"beautiful writing\" in French) at University of Edinburgh. He made rhetoric a key part of the curriculum at the premier university in Scotland and was singularly important to the role of rhetoric in the Scottish Englightenment, which then spread the focus on rhetoric through Great Britain. There are many earlier rhetorical works, but almost all were Classical, reiterating the ideas of Greek and Roman rhetoricians.\n\nAnother great place to start would be Joseph Priestly or George Campbell. They're central to one of the two main trends in rhetoric during the 18th and 19th century. They focused on belief formation and psychology, specifically on how rhetoric can be used to produce belief. They're much more philosophical than earlier rhetorical work, and in fact were a huge influence on Blair (who also takes that psychological/philosophical focus).\n\nThe Elocutionists (the other major trend of the period) provide a third starting point. They were much more practically focused, and so are much easier to read and understand and may give more insight into your interest in rhetoric from the period. They describe practical ways of reciting (declamation) and speaking, different tropes one can use, the use of emotion in speaking, etc. I'd check out Thomas Sheridan (the one Elocutionist that I enjoy reading).\n\nYou're 100% right that Rhetoric was a much larger part of the English curriculum back then (largely due to the influence of Blair in Scotland and Elocutionists teaching priests to deliver sermons). After this period (and outside of Britain and, to a lesser degree, the US) the discipline of Rhetoric was seen as a lesser form of Logic/Philosophy, with logic providing the tools to come up with ideas and rhetoric simply involving transmission of ideas. The Elocutionists - who were intentionally concerned exclusively with delivery and memorization and ignored the less practical and more philosophical elements - continued but most other discussion of rhetoric moved in the Belles Lettre part of that \"Rhetoric and Belles Lettre\" discipline that Blair created.

There may in fact be an immutable and objective reality, but we can never know what that is. It's pointless for two people to debate what is true when neither can say for sure.

As you mentioned, you may win the logical argument, but still may not convince someone to change their beliefs...\n\nHere's part of the guide I'm working on ...\n\n \\---\n\nBefore we learn how to best support our claims first we must understand the \u201cresolution process\u201d that is experienced when someone is confronted with **our** new idea or belief that conflicts with **theirs**. By understanding this process we can design an argument in a way that combats the conclusions *we don\u2019t* want our reader to make.\n\n1. They can change their initial beliefs, change their mind to your way of thinking and accept your idea.\n   1. Resulting in a change of behavior to match their new beliefs.\n   2. Resulting in acknowledgment that you are correct, but not changing their behavior.\n2. They can dispute your idea.\u00a0\n   1. Ideally, you\u2019ve made a strong enough argument to make doing this impossible without them being factually incorrect.\n   2. If this is the case you need to revisit your argument, search for where your logic or emotion breaks and loses your reader (*more on this later*).\n3. They can pull in new ideas outside the initial two *to help rationalize* their own idea against yours.\u00a0\n   1. Ideally, you will have acknowledged other alternative ideas and systematically refute them throughout your argument.\n\nIf they acknowledge you are correct, yet do not change their behavior, they are basically choosing to live with the effects (*including physiological discomfort*) of having those two conflicting ideas living in their mind at once. They resolve this conflict by simply rationalizing \u201c*you\u2019re right, but I don\u2019t care.*\u201d They rationalize that *the debate itself* is not important. You\u2019ll know this is the case if your message doesn\u2019t convert into sales, but this can be fixed\u2026 \n\n1. Examine your argument for lack of empathy, if you are simply blasting their idea as \u2018wrong\u2019, even with clean-cut proof on your end, their emotions will drive them away from you because they feel you don\u2019t understand them. Again, it\u2019s better to win the war; even if you must sacrifice a battle or two.  \n\n* *Example:* If you\u2019re trying to convince someone to buy your product to overcome addiction to vaping, yet you never acknowledge that \u2018yes it is difficult to cut the cravings, and yes many people have tried to quit and failed\u2019 they may conclude that you simply don\u2019t understand their very personal struggle.\u00a0\n\n1. Make sure you\u2019re making the high stakes clear. If they don\u2019t agree on the premise of your argument and what it *actually* means in their real-life (*the negative consequences of not accepting your argument and changing*) then you need to make sure you have made the stakes clear enough.\n\n* *Example***:** If you were trying to convince someone to quit vaping, yet you didn\u2019t make it clear (and they didn\u2019t know) that it causes cancer and reduces life span significantly than, well, *why should they care*?\n\n1. It\u2019s worth noting that *sometimes you simply can\u2019t change someone's mind* if it is too deeply entrenched in a belief; (if the denial is just too thick) not without resorting to means that wouldn\u2019t be worth the cost in time and energy\u2026 *you\u2019re not going to host an intervention to make a sale.*\n\n*---*\n\nI think the biggest element you're dealing with is that the individual may feel like you really don't understand their point of view; if you work with them to address that (show empathy) you will gain a lot of trust that will be useful when you present \"painfull\" information. **Just presenting that \"painfull\" information without them feeling like you \"get them\" is a recipe for winning the battle but losing the war.**\n\nHope that helps!", "t1_excjek6": "Finding commonplace is a really good tip, especially for debates.

Effective use of the hands, with or without the use of the voice, is a practice of great antiquity, which was developed and systematized by the Greeks and the Romans.  Various gestures had conventionalized meanings which were commonly understood, either within certain class or professional groups, or broadly among dramatic and oratorical audiences.\n\nGilbert Austin was a well-known author on chironomia.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Rhetoric/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "t1_eucvxan": "What it takes to be truly persuasive on stage is very similar to what it takes to be convincingly dramatic in a film. At the end of the day, both are performances. To make the audience feel the targeted emotion or to land on the right conclusion, you must often *exaggerate* some details while also *withholding* others. It's not enough for an actor to \"think\" or even \"feel\" the emotion for the scene, they must sprinkle in some clues and cues and a bit of \"play-acting\" to project that full emotion on screen. It's just like how memory works: when you recall a memory, you aren't rewatching a hi-fidelity recording, you are reconstructing the experience back up from just a seed of emotion or from a triggering detail you remember.\n\nConsider Tim O'Brien's idea of \"story-truth\" vs \"happening-truth\" from *The Things They Carried*:\n\n>In any war story, but especially a true one, it's difficult to separate what happened from what seemed to happen. What seems to happen becomes its own happening and has to be told that way. The angles of vision are skewed. When a booby trap explodes, you close your eyes and duck and float outside yourself. .. The pictures get jumbled, you tend to miss a lot. And then afterward, when you go to tell about it, there is always that surreal seemingness, which makes the story seem untrue, but which in fact represents the hard and exact truth as it seemed.  \n>  \n>**...I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth.**\n\nIn order to make his audience understand the horrors of war, he exaggerated certain elements of the story so that he could capture the *impact* of the feeling as he was experiencing the moment (add some pathos). If he told us exactly what happened (pure logos), it would come across as a clinical or detached or *too much*, especially since its the written word. To describe what literally happened with ever raw detail would be an empty futile exercise. As a Vietnam vet, O'Brien already has the cred (ethos) and therefore the only way to transport the audience into the moment is to tell the story with a heightened or melodramatic sense of reality and details, because that's how it *felt* to him at the time. Yuval Noah Harari says that in the Information age, where everything is data-driven, \"Knowledge is not power, *clarity* is power.\" Ergo, *show*, don't tell.\n\nAnother great example of this is the [principles of animation](https://youtu.be/pDVfNf5GvPg). Objects and characters in Pixar and Disney animations are warped in a multitude of ways in order to give off the illusion of movement. The audience is told a lie in order to perceive the truth. We distort reality to reflect reality. It's like that Emerson quote: \"We aim above the mark to hit the mark.\"\n\nThe general public hears the word Rhetoric and thinks \"eloquent manipulation\" when in fact, rhetoric is just a toolbox for effective speech (e.g. repetition, rule of three, syllogism, tropes, schemes, etc). Rhetoric gets a bad rap because we hate to admit that *everything* is performance, that everything needs a little top- or bottom-spin to hit the mark. Nothing is neutral. Nothing is truly objective. Everything is ultimately intersubjective and must reconcile with *kairos* (right time and place).\n\nWhen we communicate, we are constantly overcorrecting and censoring the content of our message on order to overcome quirks in human nature: biases, prejudices, instincts, reflexes, expectations, cliches, fallacies and blindspots. One of the most overlooked aspects of rhetoric is [chironomia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironomia). You convey and frame so much of your information within your body language, expression, voice, inflection, projection, volume, timbre, and pacing. It adds so much dimensionality. It's the difference between the original script and [the *delivery*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t1IK_9apWs) of Bill Pullman's speech from Independence day. On top of the corny music, there was a musicality to his delivery that animated the words and made them pop off the page. Likewise, hate him or love him, Trump's grotesque look and style (i.e. gold toupee, orange tan, his scowl and smirk, his big fat red tie, his little jazz hands, his sense of humor, etc) are part of his act of persuasion and it's often highly persuasive to a certain cut of the audience while being repulsive to others, but so long as it speaks to the majority, there's nothing that's beneath him. That's why even people who hate him, love to watch Trump in action. We want to see the next act of the pageantry. How bad can it get? Like watching NASCAR or a train-wreck or someone fall off the tightrope. He uses theatricality to captivate an audience. \n\nIf your medium is limited to just written language, we find other ways to add color to our language (u feel me? :) lol!!!!!!!!!! semiotics ftw \ud83c\udf46). Punctuation, vocabulary and spelling all subtly tell you something about the level of energy, irony, empathy, formality, or expertise taking place in the conversation. Those details are what make something resonant.\n\nThe art of persuasion is a 360-degree operation. In an ideal world, perhaps only the literal content of your message would and should matter. In an ideal world, syntax and semantics would be 1:1. But the fact is, context determines everything. Sometimes, style is the substance. Sometimes, the medium is the message. Sometimes, political identity determines persuasive quality. Sometimes, one detail is stronger than all the details. The fact is, anyone can reference a statistic from a journal or recite a long list of arguments or dish out logical proofs on stage. Anyone can get a phD or name-drop some dead philosopher or end on the perfect pithy proverb. Anyone can tell a sob story or describe a utopia or say the words: \"I want to make the world a better place\". But what an audience really wants to see is creativity, charisma and confidence. They want to see their ideals performed on stage. They want to see heightened reality transpire on stage. They want to see something aspirational yet attainable. They want to see themselves on stage only except a little bit stronger, braver, sexier, smarter. They want to hear what they already believe, only said better than they could ever imagine saying it.", "t1_eu8k055": "In my experience it's the interdisciplinary projects in which boundaries are most contested.

(I\u2019d recommend reading some Flusser - and remember that being a realist means that if there were no humans to perceive phenomena: there would still be stuff happening\u2014just no culture as documentation would vanish [many other authors come to mind...this book is good - https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/cartography-of-exhaustion ].).", "t1_eu7fgsw": "Honestly, I always find myself coming back to Aristotle's three rhetorical appeals (logos, ethos, and pathos). The fact is, changing someone's mind or inspiring an audience is always a multi-dimensional endeavor. Persuasion is an art, not a science. \n\nSome people are logical types. Only hard cold numbers, rationality, reason, statistics, and white papers speak to them. But others are turned off by that because for every scientific study that \"proves\" one thing, there's an equal and opposite study that \"proves\" the exact opposite. In the age of fake news, any raw data can be spun.\n\nSome people are ethical types. Only credentials matter. Only pure intentions and good will matter. They want first principles. They want seasoned experts. But others are a little more pragmatic or skeptical. They don't care about CVs or integrity. They want results or something radical. They know people flip-flop and everything is relative and managing expectations is part of the game.\n\nSome people are emotional types. They care about narratives. They care about redemption. They care about strong vision and lofty ideals. They are intuitive. They only respond to the shape of stories and originality. They respond to symbols, icons, and metaphor. But others think being emotional is weakness or naive or obsolete. Emotions are fickle and temporary. Emotions complicate the truth.\n\nEffective rhetoric must always triangulate between these three factors. An audience is sensitive to all three appeals working in unison. \n\nIt makes me think of the definition of creativity. For something to be truly creative, it must be **new**, **practical** and **effective**.

(p01yg0n41 is expressing something similar, I think.) That statement may seem really slippery and like a cop-out, but situational effects are at the heart of rhetoric since there's really ultimately no way to plan in advance what happens as a result of an attempt at persuasion. If you stand behind a podium and tell an audience \"do this because it's a good idea,\" and some do it but others just leave the crowd and think about it and tell others about it, did you succeed or fail at persuasion? I think a rhetorical perspective would argue that that question may not matter as much as trying to come to terms with what \\*did\\* happen. \n\nSo my thinking about rhetoric's definition has changed in ways that my thinking about \"audience\" has changed. I think that if I try to focus so much on what the rhetor is doing, her/himself, to set up a persuasive act, I miss where at least half of \"rhetoric\" happens--the audience.

Plato and Aristotle were writing approx. 2,500 years ago and a lot has happened since then. After the Greeks, we had Roman rhetoric for several centuries and then medieval rhetoric for several more. Then Enlightenment rhetoric for awhile, then modern rhetoric for awhile more and now we have postmodern rhetoric. So a rhetoric sub is probably not the best place to find out more about the philosophy of Ancient Greece. You'd be better off finding a history or philosophy forum.\n\nI am not an expert in ancient rhetoric; I focus on more contemporary stuff. But I'd suggest the following:\n\n + Isocrates: *Antidosis*\n\n + Plato: The *Gorgias* and *Phaedrus* diaglogues\n\n + Aristotle: *Rhetoric* and *Nichomachean Ethics*\n\nYou might also try *Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students* and *Rhetoric Reclaimed* for a more modern take on the work of the ancients.", "t1_eq79kz1": "Yes absolutely \nAnd anything for logic", "t1_eq797sn": "My main focus is to learn liberal arts \nAnd trivium .", "t1_eq78wkt": "Start with grammar and go from there.", "t1_eq78bwe": "Actually lastly I was reading Platos republic so after reading it the dialogue I am pretty impressed so I was trying to read more like it \nThe real purpose of my book reading to understand the Athens philosophy background and above the classic content \nI want to read on that  genre", "t1_eq77dcv": "Whole lot but how ?", "t1_eq6x4lq": "Yes, literally thousands of books.

There is no paper in the published literature that would have that sentence in the conclusion, let alone ALL of them. Science doesn't \"prove\" anything. It's not possible because that's not how science works. The scientists who wrote the conclusion would know that, even if you don't. Even if somehow the scientist didn't know that, the other scientists who reviewed the results would know it. And to say that *every* study comes to the same \"final\" conclusion is patently absurd: each study takes up different questions from different perspectives and there is no such thing as a \"final\" conclusion.\n\nYour casual identification of the sociologist you spoke with as \"liberal\" betrays your bias. The distinguishing characteristic of a sociologist is not their political party, but their research community. You're seeming to say that to you, all sociologists look the same: liberal. Maybe they do, to you, but the bias not only clouds your thinking and interferes with your vision, it also suggests that you have an ulterior motive. You have ideological reasons for refuting the argument, not factual ones.\n\nI find that you are the one ignoring the facts. You are the one who has let bias blind you to the evidence. You are the one seeking to maintain your beliefs in the face of evidence and analysis conducted by experts. \n\nYou ask some questions that deserve answers. The only way to come to those answers is through study. If you're not going to invest the time and resources to properly study those questions yourself, and you're going to write off the answers you get from the people who have actually done so, dedicating their lives to better understanding incarceration for example, then it seems to me you're not really interested in finding answers, but in satisfying a predetermined ideological inclination.

Arguing that deterrence is ineffective, rephrased, is arguing that deterrence does NOT have an effect. Arguing that any given action will NOT have any given effect is not much of an argument by itself, but a response to the assumption that it does have an effect.  In general, when making an  argument, the word \"not \" should be avoided unless someone else argues the antithesis.   \n\n\nFor instance, arguing that Trump's proposed border wall will not stop immigrants from coming over is a weak argument. What arguments like these lack is an Impact. Adam Ruins Everything runs the argument that \"Trumps border wall will INCREASE illegal immigration.\" Arguments like these are more effective because they exist to do more than neutralize another argument. \n\nIn general, arguing for marginal impacts also seems to fall in the realm of refutation as opposed to an argument. Arguing that \"deterrence has a smaller effect than people think\" could be interesting and productive for the public discourse, but by themselves cannot do much to change minds.  \nThe solution to improve these counterclaims being used as claims is to engage in the counterfactual. Rather than just saying the wall wont work and deterrence in ineffective, these claims should be rephrased positively with an mutually exclusive alternative or should identify a unique harm. The natural borders and current infrastructure provide enough of a barrier to curtail illegal immigration; the wall will increase illegal immigration; community policing is more effective than deterrence; deterrence leads to more crime.   \n\n\nIf deterrence doesn't hurt anyone and there isn't something better to replace it, then people will maintain deterrence policies.

But your question is wonderful.) OK., so here is a practical example. In Clinton's (in)famous Alt Right speech delivered in Reno in August of 2016 (I think it was August), she argues against Trump's wall by attempting to establish Trump's bad faith. Oh, and Mexico isn't going to pay for that wall, says she, and I'm paraphrasing; you, the taxpayers, will foot the bill. Here are the problems with her objection as I see them: (a) She let's stand all of Trump's arguments with respect to why we may need a border-wall. She addresses not one of them. (b) Her objection based on Trump's bad faith does not address the issue of the wall itself. Can you infer from her objection based on Trump's bad faith a reason or reasons for why we *don't* need a wall? No, no you can't. Other than perhaps to save money, which is a trivial sort of claim. (c) She frames an urgent human rights issue as a simple fiscal question in an era of trillion dollar deficits (We're already spending beyond our means. So this would be just another choice among choices of spending beyond our means. Does she really want to urge austerity when most of her own proposals assume the form of unfunded mandates or claims on the public treasury?) (d) Will anyone who actually wants a wall be dissuaded by the question of who pays for it? Seriously: Try to imagine a red-hat who lost their job because their factory work was outsourced overseas, or whose wages are depressed because of cheap immigrant labour, rejecting the proposal of a border wall because tax money will be used to pay for it. This is tax money that our hypothetical red-hat is not paying anyway, not paying because they're unemployed or under-employed.\n\nThe question of Trump's bad faith not only does absolutely no work for Clinton, but what is far worse, it distracts her from the actual issues that obtain from the question of a border wall.\n\n(In my own estimation Trump's \"and Mexico will pay for it\" attached to his \"we're going to build a wall\" claim was a super-effective troll. Whether Mexico would pay for the wall became everyone's talking point, whether in the media or behind the podiums of rival candidates, and *not* the question of a wall itself, a wall the rationale for which you have to ASSUME on its face to address the question of who pays for it. It detoured Clinton herself into the funhouse of who pays for the wall when the issue was the wall itself.)", "t1_ept1pq3": "Question: Is Socrates use of irony, ridicule, \"facetiousness,\" or maieutics instances of bad faith? Is Socrates' heuristic ignorance an instance of bad faith? Is playing devil's advocate or the use of an heuristic doubt an instance of bad faith? Maybe. Maybe not. I suppose that would depend on the intentions of your interlocutor. But whether yes or no these gestures can produce new insights or deepen shared understandings. So they can be useful. But who cares? If you remain steadfast in your exposition of your own case, you can turn any behavior of your interlocutor to your advantage. Are they ridiculing you? They had to go off-topic to do so. Refuse the bait; do not join them. Let them waste their own airtime as you gently, playfully remind them that you were never the issue and continue to develop your own case. Are they acting in bad faith? Treat their (allegedly) feigned position as an hypothetical and use the opportunity to repeat or to develop your position anew. Now you can experiment with different ways of delivering or articulating your position, or, if you're being sea lioned (a kind of trolling), and, hence, you already established your position (for your audience) and there is no further progress to be made as your interlocutor can bring nothing new to the table but questions or objections that are trivial in character and by no means decisive, politely excuse yourself as you wander off to join a more interesting discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSea lioning is Sargon of Akkad's method. He will object to one or more of your terms or the use of your terms, over and over, and then he struts about as if he's accomplished anything at all. Richard Spender's rejoinder was priceless: \"You're not as smart as you think you are.\" But does Sargon act in bad faith? No, I would like to say, I think he honestly believes that this is how you debate. Can I establish that he either acts in bad faith or that he believes that this is how you debate? No. I can't read minds. But even if I could establish this, would i get anything out of it? No. The world is still the world. My judgments and estimations of it are something else entirely; they say more about me than about the world, and I can revise or revoke them at any time (I often do). That this is his method is the most I can say with confidence based solely on the unscientific sample of my few observations. One or more counter-examples would be enough to overthrow my super-weak case or at least require that I qualify it with a modal operator: This is *often* SoA's method. There. That's less weak, but still kind of useless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any case, always ask yourself, what is your goal? What is your endgame?

What have you accomplished precisely? Only that your interlocutor has acted or acts in bad faith in some sense, whatever that means. The actual argument or arguments still stand. You still have to answer them. Hence, to establish bad faith--I am allowing, for the sake of argument, that to conclusively demonstrate bad faith is even possible--solves no problem for you, nor does it do any useful work. This is why bluff, irony, and ridicule are so powerful: they cause a lot of people to lose the plot. And when they shoot down rabbit holes trying to establish your bad faith or what a horrid person you are, your actual arguments are left untouched. (This is one of the many ways Trump and his surrogates gaslight the media. And our super-genius \"journalists\" take the bait every single time. Does Trump act in bad faith? Of course he does, he says so in his Art of the Deal, so this is a rare case when you can actually establish bad faith. BUT: Does he care that you know this? Does it do any work for you at all that you know this? Does it even matter at all that you can establish this? No, it doesn't. You've accomplished precisely nothing. I suppose if Trump actually cared what any random journalism school graduate thought of him this *could* be effective, but he clearly doesn't, and this programmatic indifference is his superpower. To take what he says ON ITS FACE and dispassionately, would be the correct, most ethical, AND the most effective rejoinder.) When accused of bad faith or hidden motives etc., which is all the time, I typically just own it: \"Well, OK., let's say that I am, so what? First, what follows from that with respect to my position, and, second, you have yet to address either x or y.\" This typically ends any discussion of bad faith.", "t1_epszisy": "Then it would be appropriate to ask, \"Are you being facetious, because I think you are based on x, y?\" But say that your interlocutor answers, \"Why, yes, yes I am, but my points still stand.\" What have you accomplished, precisely? Is irony or facetiousness necessarily bad faith though? Is ridicule? Is any behaviour that we might not like an instance of bad faith? What does bad faith actually look like or sound like? Or is it more like a stance or an attitude? Bad faith, I would say, is a value judgment that we assign from the outside; it's not the kind of thing we can simply point to. But even if we could point to it--well, so what?--what have we accomplished other than to share our value judgment? Everything else in the known universe remains stubbornly in place, and this includes our interlocutor's position.", "t1_epskufa": ">I get your point.

Some of them, though, will come around after the argument is over and they have had some time to reflect. I sometimes think of this like planting seeds in my interlocutors mind that are likely to grow later. One key thing for this is to handle your interlocutor gently and with respect.  If you make an ass of yourself, their reflection will be focused on recounting all the ways in which you were an ass and they'll be very invested in remembering you as being wrong. If you're nice and respectful, their reflection will focus more on what you said and who was right. To return to the metaphor, kindness can make the seeds you plant more likely to grow. One argumentative method that works well for this is the socratic questioning method, wherein you ask questions of your interlocutor with the aim of eventually reducing their argument to absurdity. When you reach the absurdity/contradiction, don't start bashing the point in with a hammer. In fact, you don't even have to point the absurdity out (think enthymeme). Most will notice it on their own and, after a few days, start re-examining their perspectives.\n\nIf the latter, most methods work fine. Again, just don't make an ass of yourself.

Gorgias v. Plato (Socrates). So like, Gorgias is considered the daddy mack of rhetoric, before Aristotle. Gorgias and Plato have a big argument, Plato wants to make rhetoric only in service to the \"T\"ruth. Like, what good is argument if you ain't looking for the Forms? or Facts for that matter? Gorgias sees it as a skill, something to teach and be good at. He is considered a 'sophist' (origin of the term 'sophistry'). The sophists would engage in what was called the 'dissoi logoi' where people would give speeches and argue both sides of the same issue. Plato is not cool with this for a few reasons. First, this makes it harder to find \"T\"ruth if people will just argue for the weaker position or against the \"T\"ruth. Second, it fucks over Philosophers who seek to find the \"T\"ruth because Plato wrote this big 'ole thing called The Republic where he says the person who should be the king would be the most knowledgeable, (i.e. the philosopher king), this idea jacks his idea that he should have power. Third, students are leaving Plato to go hang and learn from sophists, which is super-uncool cuz now they're cutting in on his cheddar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Plato pulls this dick move and says, \"O RLY? Well let's see what SOCRATES has to say about this!\" Then Plato writes a thing called \"Gorgias\" where he makes up an imaginary conversation between Socrates and Gorgias where they get in an argument and Socrates wins. Imagine that. Aristotle later comes by and writes a book on rhetoric aptly titled Rhetoric where he tries to bridge those gaps. He talks about logos (your logical arguments) but also talks about ethos and pathos! Now even Aristotle downplayed the importance of ethos and pathos a little bit, but he still said it was a big part of persuasion, and he was right!\n\nEven though what Plato did was a dick move, it does explain a big division between the study of rhetoric and the study of philosophy. Philosophy has their way of teaching argument, and if you notice, the guy giving the lecture you've shared in your last post? Kevin deLaPlante, he's a philosophy professor who graduated from Western University in London, Ontario. Philosophy is significant, but so is Canada! Let me explain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're right. There's a movement of 'informal logic' when it comes to argument that tries to account for everyday argument. That is one of three schools of argument. That school is housed primarily in Canadian universities and scholarship. They do their thing, and that's fine. But it's not what we would call a rhetorical view of argument scholarship. That is what is housed in the US. The US version of argument is about argument for persuasion and audience effect. The European school is 'pragma-dialectics' but I don't think we need to really get into that now, it's a little different though.\n\nI did mention the Toulmin model for argument, and Toulmin also was a philosopher. But philosophy as a field kinda was 'meh' with his work, but us folks in Communication took that ball and ran with it. We were all, \"Whoa, this is great because it deals with uncertainty WAY better than informal logic does. Let's teach this in all our argument courses!\" And then we'll also make scholarship saying models are shit (Willard) but that's another story..\n\nSo, if you're sub is about /r/badrhetoric and you're talking about arguments, I'd suspect you'd want to do so from the rhetorical school of argument. Maybe you don't however! It's YOUR sub! Not mine!\n\nIf there's anything else I can help with drop me a DM and I'll be happy to send some reading list stuff or w/e. This is me spitballing and some other PhD probably is reading this and saying, \"Kinda but not really\" and would love to correct me on things. Go for it, I\"m always open to critique.\n\n&#x200B;", "t1_ejn46kc": "Wanted to say some things in defense of the study of logic in rhetoric.\n\nI should start out by saying my views on what it is and what it is for, which is that logic is a tool for modeling modes of human thought and reasoning. Fallacies are simply thinking that leads to untrue conclusions, while logical rules and syllogisms are modes of thought that lead to true conclusions (if it is taken for a given that you have good information). There is even [Inductive logic](https://criticalthinkeracademy.com/courses/what-is-probability/lectures/51587) which is used for everyday decisions, limited information and uncertainty.\n\nIt is also mostly unavoidable when, as any statement you make that is not declarative will be some form of proposition. It is used more commonly than it appears, and is even used in movements and groups that have apparently bizarre beliefs. The flat earth movement for example has a list of arguments that they refer to support their belief (much to do with not trusting any form of evidence, and some jargon about vision). There are also speakers who sound illogical, yet are relying on allusion and previous statements made elsewhere in order to make sense to their audience.  Many such groups have correct logical argument to support, but start with false or alien premises. For an example of how this can come about, I will posit that the statement.\n\n>The earth is flat. Up is down. Therefore I am standing underneath the earth\n\nIs a perfectly valid, yet not even close to being remotely correct (sound).  This fact makes logic weaker as a scientific tool, but reinforces its use as a rhetorical tool, which can be used to both construct and dismantle arguments. I see logic in speech as being similar to grammar in speech. It is unavoidable, and using it incorrectly will make you sound foolish.", "t1_ejk5eaw": "Thankyou. Will be adding the Tolimine model. I totally get the last point (under the edit tag) about fallacies. I should probably include the \"fallacy fallacy\" in the list to avoid this. Also noticed that places list fallacies that are not actually fallacies as well (appeal to emotion was listed in one place.) Got into this through philosophy, hence the emphasis on logic in the list. Enjoy the sub!\n"}
