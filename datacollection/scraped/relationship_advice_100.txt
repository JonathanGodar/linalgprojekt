We had one kitten who was super destructive, we both worked a lot, and the vet recommended a second cat to help him with his behavioral issues. \n\nOver the next year, we had many many discussions about getting another cat. He was adamant that he did not want one. Despite the fact that I did want one, I would have NEVER brought another cat home without his permission.\n\nEventually, I dropped the subject as it was a point of contention between us and all of the sudden, a few months later, *he* came to *me* about getting a second kitten. He picked out the second kitten. He had 100% say in the second kitten through the entire adoption process. \n\nNow, we both couldn\u2019t be happier with our choice as it has really settled our first kitten down that they can play with each other.\n\nThat being said, cats are not dogs. Dogs require an enormous amount of work. My best friend owns a very large dog and I once did the calculations \u2014 I could feed 8 cats extremely high end food for the cost of what she feeds her single dog every month. They need to be walked, they need to be let out. They are capable of 10x more destruction than cats. I would have NEVER brought home any animal without my partner\u2019s full agreeance. She disrespected you in a huge way and I would be furious. Personally, I think you have every right to end a relationship over this.", "t1_kbitteq": "Welcome to /r/relationship_advice.
