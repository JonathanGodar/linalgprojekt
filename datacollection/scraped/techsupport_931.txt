If so a component was bad, so power off and one component at a time reconnect and power on again until I got to the one that prevented boot.\n\nThis was the test I needed to see if the motherboard was dead.\n\nI tried it and it actually worked!\n\nSystem booted completely to Windows login with abhorrent onboard graphics.\n\nSo apparently the spark and smoke didn't kill my motherboard at all or anything else connected.\n\n**All components checked out, until I got to the GPU and then it wouldn't boot again.**\n\nSo it's the GPU... somehow.\n\nI tried all different cables and pcie auxillary ports on the PSU to get the GPU to work and allow the system to boot but nothing.\n\nI tried my old graphics card and it runs fine. So I guess if nothing else at least I can still run that until I get a replacement for the dead on arrival new GPU.\n\nAs for why the GPU is dead, I have no idea.\n\nCan't be a wattage/PSU issue because I made sure to get a PSU with sufficient wattage before even installing, and I over shot the recommended by like 100 watts.\n\nCan't be too much watts either because everything runs fine with the older GPU.\n\nIt could be static shock that killed it because I don't have a static line, and was on carpet during install just trying to touch the case every time before touching any components. At that I also tried to be extremely careful with the new GPU and was extremely careless with the old one I removed. And the old one works fine.\n\nMaybe it could be a bad connection with the GPU as I mistakenly tried to force the psu end of the cable into it not realizing they're basically keyed to run only one direction, just like the 24 pin except less obvious so I didn't catch it at first. Although the 24 pin being keyed that way I should've known they all would be. I successfully forced the wrong end of the connector for the CPU power supply but that didn't cause any problems with the CPU connection.\n\nMy old GPU has an indicator light for the power connector that appears to light up red when the connection is bad but white when it's good.\n\nI don't know if that's standard but the new GPU also has a power source indicator but all day it has only lit red. If red/white connection status indicator is industry standard then I suppose the red light confirms the connection is bad. BUT I can't find anything online to confirm that, so it's possible it only has a red power source indicator and no connection status indicator.\n\nIn any case any and all attempts I've made to run my new GPU have bricked my system, so I've wasted a lot of time an money, waited weeks to get all complements in, and absolutely wasted what was already a bad day I needed some relief from which should have been this going smoothly only to not unwind any other way either since it didn't and I kept trying all night. Fun.\n\nI guess now I'll have to exchange my GPU back for a replacement and wait another week or two for that!\n\nBut I guess at least I can play old games at Max settings with my old GPU until then \ud83d\ude44", "t1_kbi4061": "/r/applehelp", "t1_kbi3wux": "Create a Google Spreadsheet and get people to send you updates.

Tinywall is the only one I found that did it and made it easy to do within 5 minutes of installation. It automatically blocks everything aside from the Windows processes you need to use the internet. All you have to do is select the apps to allow. It's as simple as opening the app, selecting 'whitelist by window' from the icon at the bottom, and one-click over the window running the app to grant access. You don't even need to know the process.

Yes, wear leveling cycles trough the cells that data is written to in order to spread out the writes and prolong the lift of the nand. And they have extra space that they do this with call over-provisioning. But, what you are missing is that all modern SSD controllers, and this is going back to the SLC days when SSDs were still new to the consumer market, have garbage collection built into them. So when they use wear leveling, the data is written to a new cell instead of an old cell, the old cell's contents are deleted. The data is not just sitting there in the cell. To write to an SSD cell, the cell must be reset to 0 before you can write to it.
