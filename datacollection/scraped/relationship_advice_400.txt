We had one kitten who was super destructive, we both worked a lot, and the vet recommended a second cat to help him with his behavioral issues. \n\nOver the next year, we had many many discussions about getting another cat. He was adamant that he did not want one. Despite the fact that I did want one, I would have NEVER brought another cat home without his permission.\n\nEventually, I dropped the subject as it was a point of contention between us and all of the sudden, a few months later, *he* came to *me* about getting a second kitten. He picked out the second kitten. He had 100% say in the second kitten through the entire adoption process. \n\nNow, we both couldn\u2019t be happier with our choice as it has really settled our first kitten down that they can play with each other.\n\nThat being said, cats are not dogs. Dogs require an enormous amount of work. My best friend owns a very large dog and I once did the calculations \u2014 I could feed 8 cats extremely high end food for the cost of what she feeds her single dog every month. They need to be walked, they need to be let out. They are capable of 10x more destruction than cats. I would have NEVER brought home any animal without my partner\u2019s full agreeance.

But I think it\u2019s worth considering, because right now it looks to me like there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover.  And I think that while you consider cleaning to be stress management, it may not actually be doing that job for you, because of the OCD.\n\nIn the meantime, what about trying to work out a system of deescalation with your bf?  For example, establish ahead of time (when not stressed or angry) that, when either of you says a signal word of some sort, it\u2019s a clear signal that you\u2019re fraying badly.  Then that person says \u201cI need (X)\u201d, where X can be \u201ca half hour alone\u201d or \u201csome quiet in the apartment\u201d or \u201cto be held\u201d or \u201ca conversation\u201d or whatever.  Then the other person gives that person the space or support they need, and both of you make concerted efforts not to escalate in volume or tone.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say \u201cclean for me!\u201d  This is solely about trying to deescalate and destress so that you can continue communication together.  Then you can approach the conversation of chores from a less stressed, less angry perspective.  After that, apologize to each other for any harsh words that happen, or neglect, or just contributing to the stress.  The more you do that when stress flares up, the easier it will be to do again.  Eventually, that will come more easily than angry lashing out.\n\nAgain, it may be that ultimately, you\u2019re too far apart on the household management spectrum to resolve together.  It may be that he\u2019s just not going to be up to the level of cleaning that you require - it\u2019s onerous for a lot of people to deep clean.  But I think of you can work out a better system of deescalation and communication - that is, address the issue calmly and fairly before it reaches the angry shouting and threats - then at least you can find out whether you can find a long term compromise that you\u2019re both happy with.", "t1_kbisr1e": "I didn\u2019t even need to read the post to tell you NO.

I (27f) was with my ex (28m) for 3 years. 2 of those years we lived together and we started to slowly have less sex/do sexual things over time. What once was a few times a week, became me basically begging for him to want me, and it got down to every few weeks that anything would happen (if that). He also had similar behaviors, he\u2019d watch porn everyday and then either wait till I was at work or go secretly masturbate and then say he was too tired or not interested in having sex. I started initiating every time and got creative, but he\u2019d always say no. So then I used to wait till he initiated, but it started becoming less too, and I also eventually became uninterested. It hurt a lot and I never felt more unattractive in my life. \n\nI ended up breaking up with him and that was one of the main reasons. I think we just were not compatible enough and as much as I wanted to understand, it was breaking my heart and confidence to be with someone who didn\u2019t want me. I never minded him watching porn either, as I watch it too. I would even suggest to watch it together and he denied. \n\nIdk, I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is it sounds like you are trying really hard to be understanding and make things work. It takes two though and if this is important to you, which it sounds like it is, he should listen and try. If he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019d say accept it and accept that it\u2019ll continue to get worse even or maybe try to move on.
